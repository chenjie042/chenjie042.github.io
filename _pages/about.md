I am a CIMES postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University and NOAA GFDL, where I collaborate closely with Dr. Lucas Harris in the FV3 team (since August 2021). Prior to joining Princeton, I did my PhD with Prof. Dan Chavas in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Purdue University. I will be joining the Nanjing-Helsinki Institute in Atmospheric and Earth System Sciences (NHI) at Nanjing University as an assistant professor in Spring 2025.

Motivated by my experiences in storm chasing and hazard reconnaissance during Hurricane Irma in 2017, my research focuses primarily on landfalling tropical cyclones and extreme weather in a changing environment. I am dedicated to: advancing the physical understanding of landfalling hurricanes, developing theoretical solutions to describe and predict the hurricane inland evolution, and creating new frameworks to assess modeled hurricane inland wind fields. Additionally, I collaborate with colleagues to explore the social impacts of hurricanes and seek solutions for vulnerable populations. My career goal is to effectively communicate our physical understanding of inland hurricanes to a broader community, aiming to improve forecasts and enhance resilience to high-impact weather events.

I am looking for students and postdocs to join our team, please feel free to reach out for more information!
