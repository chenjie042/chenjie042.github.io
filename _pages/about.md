This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
I am a CIMES postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University and NOAA GFDL, where I collaborate closely with Dr. Lucas Harris in the FV3 team (since August 2021). Prior to joining Princeton, I did my PhD with Prof. Dan Chavas in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Purdue University. I will be joining the Nanjing-Helsinki Institute in Atmospheric and Earth System Sciences (NHI) at Nanjing University as an assistant professor in Spring 2025.

Motivated by my experiences in storm chasing and hazard reconnaissance during Hurricane Irma in 2017, my research focuses primarily on landfalling tropical cyclones and extreme weather in a changing environment. I am dedicated to: advancing the physical understanding of landfalling hurricanes, developing theoretical solutions to describe and predict the hurricane inland evolution, and creating new frameworks to assess modeled hurricane inland wind fields. Additionally, I collaborate with colleagues to explore the social impacts of hurricanes and seek solutions for vulnerable populations. My career goal is to effectively communicate our physical understanding of inland hurricanes to a broader community, aiming to improve forecasts and enhance resilience to high-impact weather events.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
